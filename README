Package description:
This package contains the generalized Ising model ground
state solver. There are three subpackages - "ising", which is the solver
iself, "ccls", which is a MAX-SAT solver optimized for spin-glass problems,
and "ccls_lb", which is a modified version of the ccls solver optimized for
this particular use case. These packages are based on the AkMAXSAT code, as
well as the CCLS2014 code.

Prerequisites:
This package is tested using GCC 4.8.2, and Gurobi 5.6.3, although we expect
that it should work fine with other versions of GCC and Gurobi as we do not
rely on any particularly recent features introduced in either code.

Installation:
1. Set the Gurobi INCLUDE and LIB directories in the build.sh script
2. Run the build.sh script

Execution:
The bin directory contains a number of executables - these must at all times
be located in the same directory, so if you move them, they must all be moved
together. The main executable is "ising", while the others are needed for
intermediate steps in the solver.
Thus, to run the code, copy the entire contents of the bin/ directory to the
directory where you have the J_config.in and J_in.in files:
    cp <ising root>/bin/* <run_dir>/
And run the main executable:
    cd <run_dir>/
    ./ising

Input:
The "ising" executable assumes the presence of two files in its directory -
"J_in.in", which contains the cluster expansion ECI's, and "J_config.in",
which contains the setup for the solver execution. See the provided examples
for the format of these files.

Configuration (J_config.in):
NSITES: Maximum number of sites in a unit cell to consider (default=50)
NLOOPS: Number of lower bound optimization loops (default=4)
LABEL: Label for the calculation (default=IS0)
PREC: Numerical precision for the ECI's (default 1e-6)
MODE_JPLUSMINUS: 0 - ECI's and correlations in 0/1 form (default)
                 1 - ECI's and correlations in -1/+1 form
MODE_SOLVER: 0 - Exact solution
             1 - Pseudo-optimization without proof (default)
             2 - Pseudo-optimization with proof
MODE_VERBOSITY: 0 - Silent
                1 - Input and output to stdout (default)
                2 - General calculation defailts to stdout
                3 - Every little detail to stdout
